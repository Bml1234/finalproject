## üì± Breakpoint Logic

The website follows a mobile-first responsive design approach:

### Breakpoints
- **Mobile**: Default (0px - 767px)

### Responsive Behavior
- **Navigation**: Transforms to mobile menu with hamburger toggle below 768px
- **Hero Section**: Stacks from 2-column grid to single column on mobile
- **Service Cards**: Adapts from multi-column grid to single column
- **Resource Grid**: Reduces from 4 columns to 2 on tablet, 1 on mobile
- **Footer**: Switches from multi-column to single column layout

### Typography Scaling
- **Hero Title**: 3.5rem desktop ‚Üí 2.5rem tablet ‚Üí 2rem mobile
